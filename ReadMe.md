Just stores some data identifying packages in a SQLite DB and paths of their files in a prefix tree. Allows you to get a package by a file.

See [`tests/tests.py`](./tests/tests.py) for the examples.

Requirements
------------
* [`Python >=3.4`](https://www.python.org/downloads/). [`Python 2` is dead, stop raping its corpse.](https://python3statement.org/) Use `2to3` with manual postprocessing to migrate incompatible code to `3`. It shouldn't take so much time. For unit-testing you need Python 3.6+ or PyPy3 because their `dict` is ordered and deterministic. Python 3 is also semi-dead, 3.7 is the last minor release in 3.
* [`datrie`](https://github.com/pytries/datrie) for a prefix tree.
